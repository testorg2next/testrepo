nothing

# 0.0.6
Forgot to update the README with 0.0.6 release

# 0.0.7 2024-09-12
Assume this README.md is our testrepo stand-in for a CHANGELOG.md
I'll stick a date on it...
Here's the new 0.0.7 stuff
Should we be doing these sections in reverse order so the latest is always at the top?

# 0.0.8
Try publishing from fork!
